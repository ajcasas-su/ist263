    <h1>The Best Guitar Players Through the Decades</h1>
    <header>
        If you ask someone who their favorite guitar player is, they will likely name someone from their youth, from a decade where new music was most exciting to them. However, itâ€™s hard to compare all players at once because of how constantly music is evolving. In this list, I will be making a case for the best guitar player of each decade since the sixties.

    <h2>The 60s: Jimi Hendrix</h2>

    <p>
        It's hard to imagine what the rest of this list would look like without Jimi Hendrix. He took what playing guitar was supposed to be and flipped it upside down. From the passionate and melodic solos of "Wind Cries Mary" and "Little Wing" to the raging, proto-metal guitar beatdowns of "Voodoo Child" and "Machine Gun," Hendrix had range. Even his skills aside, he was an incredible performer to watch. In a time where any type of onstage antics would have parents taking away their kids' records, Hendrix would thrash around, burn guitars, and play with his teeth. It's very difficult to concisely convey how many techniques he pioneered that are still used today, more than fifty years after his passing.

    <h2>The 70s: David Gilmore</h2>

    <p>
        Going from an eccentric performer like Jimi Hendrix to David Gilmour of Pink Floyd is a jarring change. Gilmour may not be the type to incinerate guitars or smash his amps, but his impact is just as important in guitar history. What's special about Gilmour is his blues background, which seems uninteresting until you realize he is a blues player in a psychedelic, ambient band. A pairing like this makes for some fascinating and, at the time, unheard-of sonic textures. As well, he was a master of soundscapes. With just his guitar, he could turn a song into a floating and spacey river of sound.

    <h2>The 80s: Prince</h2>

    <img src="../images/prince.jpg" alt="Prince" class="hidden">


    <p>
        When talking about the greatest guitar players to ever live, people always seem to forget about Prince. They remember him from his pop hits like "Kiss" or "1999," which are incredible songs but have no focus on guitar. The reason is Prince was a songwriter first. He would never let on that he was a great guitar player until it was suited for the song. Within seconds, a song could go from an emotionally moving ballad to a shreddy, face-melting guitar riff that could last anywhere from half a second to three minutes.    </p>

    <h2>The 90s: Tom Morello</h2>

    <p>
        By the early 90s, hip hop was already a mainstay in the music industry next to more guitar-influenced genres like pop and rock. Although most rock guitarists held bitterness toward hip hop, Tom Morello felt otherwise. He took influence from the excitement of the budding genre and blended it with the punk music he played as a teen. This created an inventive new sound that he showcased in his band Rage Against the Machine. With the help of effects pedals, Morello essentially transformed his guitar into other instruments. Most famously, he can manipulate his guitar in such a way that he could sound like a DJ scratching a vinyl record, as heard in "Bulls on Parade."

    <h2>The 00s: Jack white</h2>

    <img src="../images/jack_white.jpg" alt="jack white" class="hidden">


    <p>
        In the year 2000, no one could have expected that the music industry was ready for a band like The White Stripes. Rock music at the time was oversaturated with rap-metal bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit. How would a garage rock duo from Detroit fit into that equation? Jack White brought rock back to its basics: simple but massive riffs that are so catchy that they are chanted by tens of thousands in sports stadiums around the world. A buzzing and fuzzy guitar tone that sounds like it was ripped straight out of the '70s. White brought back a dirty bluesy sound but with some twists. Like Tom Morello, Jack White brought guitar pedals into the mix to bring his sound into the 21st century.

    <h2>The 10s: st Vincent</h2>

    <img src="../images/Annie_Clark.jpg" alt="annie clark" class="hidden">


    <p>
        In a culture that sees guitar-heavy music falling out of the mainstream, people like St. Vincent are keeping it alive. Although inspired by all her predecessors on this list, you could never tell from her music. Her music and guitar playing are inventive and hard to pin down. However, if I had to describe it, her playing would be jerky, rhythmic, and never really concerned about sounding like a guitar, in the best way possible. But like Prince, in her songs, the guitar is never in the spotlight until it serves the song.
