    <h1>Gear and Career Highlights</h1>

    <h3>Jimi Hendrix</h3>
    <p>
        Being from the sixties Jimi Hendrix didn’t have a large amount of gear to choose from. The distorted guitar had just been invented little more than a decade prior. Because it had the gain and feedback to play with he used a Marshall amp. Another large factor is his equipment option was that he was left handed and left handed guitars were rare to non-existent back then. He eventually decided on a Fender Stratocaster flipped upside down which became his signature.

    <h3>David Gilmore</h3>
    <p>
        Just like Hendrix, Gilmore’s guitar of choice is a 1970 black Stratocaster. Throughout the 70s he used this guitar on every song pink Floyd recorded. In combination with a lesser know amp company called hi watt David Gilmore achieved his bright and sustaining guitar sound

    <h3>Prince</h3>
    <p>
        Prince was like no other guitar player and the equipment he used reflected that. Ever guitar he played was custom made for him to look exactly how he wanted. His most famous instrument, the purple rain guitar, was bright white with gold accents and had a swirling horn. Something only prince could pull off. For his amp section he used a Mesa Boogie combo.

    <h3>Tom Morello</h3>
    <p>
        Morello is the first person on this list to really take advantage of guitar pedals to go beyond what people thought a guitar could sound like. He use an effect called the Digitech whammy that could pitch his guitar up or down and octave. Which made for made for synth like guitar sounds that he could manipulate to sound like anything from DJ scratches to incoming helicopters. Morello played a custom guitar based on the Stratocaster plugged into a Marshall JCM 800.

    <h3>Jack White</h3>
    <p>
        Jack white was influence heavily by the guitar sounds of the late 60s and 70s and even being a more modern player,
        he played gear almost exclusively from that era. Jack white is unique on this list because he didn’t use expensive gear. He used a bright red fiber glass guitar from the 60s that would constantly have to be fixed for its unreliability.  For his amp, White used a Silver Tone 100-watt, an amp that sears used to sell in their catalogs.
        <br><b>Career Highlight:</b> White Stripes - Death Letter (Live - Blackpool)

    <h3>St. Vincent</h3>
    <p>
        Since the debut of her signature Ernie Ball guitar in 2015, st Vincent has rarely been seen playing any other guitar. Seen in the middle of the picture above, the guitar sports an angular design that sets it apart from the usual 60 year old guitar aesthetics that most guitarists favor.
