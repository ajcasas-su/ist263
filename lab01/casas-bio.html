        Hello, my name is Alex Casas. I am currently a senior in Syracuse Universityâ€™s ischool program. I major in information management and technology, and I am working toward a concentration in information security. Though my major I have gained proficiency in coding languages such as R, SQL and python. Also, I have learned other tech related skills like cloud computing, computer networking, risk management and project management. personally, I am from New Rochelle, New York where I live with my parents my brother and my dog. Outside of my major, one of my favorite hobbies is music. I am always either listening to music or playing the guitar. I also really enjoy movies. some of my favorites are The Social Network, Whiplash, and Knives Out.
